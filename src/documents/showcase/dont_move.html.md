[Don't Move](http://www.desura.com/games/dont-move) by [steverichey](https://github.com/steverichey).

Ninjas, failure, ludonarrative dissonance and player investment manipulation.

Don't Move starts simply: move left or right. But as you try -- and as you fail -- to move, you unlock more of the game's mechanisms. With each new element comes new challenges and more rewards!

Don't Move is available for Windows PCs, and coming soon to Android, Linux, and Flash.
