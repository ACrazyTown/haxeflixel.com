//todo




Contributing code to HaxeFlixel is done all through the official git repositories on Github. We make use of the pull request feature and suggest developers use a feature branch model.

###Feature branches

Git feature branches allow work to be developed that may have deep breaking changes on the codebase. The general rule is to simply fork the project and create a new branch and name it using a name that best describes the feature your developing. 

When you have recieved feedback made tests.

- Link to a working demo of your feature, bugfix etc.
- Include a summary explaining the reason and logic behind your changes.

###Merge Approval

Before a major feature is merged into core our general workflow has been to get approval from 2 or more contributors with push access. If it is hard to get consensus on a major change all developers involved agree the original author of this project (Beeblerox) has the more important vote.
