Installing HaxeFlixel is made simple through Haxe's package manager Haxelib. Using [Haxelib](http://haxe.org/doc/haxelib/using_haxelib) will let you install the latest stable version of HaxeFlixel.

```

```

Haxelib will notice the dependency of openfl and may prompt you to install it if you have not installed it yet:

The latest release version of HaxeFlixel is now on your system, depending on what openfl setup "target" commands you have run in the previous book you can now start compiling. The next pages will show you how to install an IDE or test HaxeFlixel right away with the command line.
