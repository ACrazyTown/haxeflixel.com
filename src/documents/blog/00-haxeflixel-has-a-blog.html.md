The HaxeFlixel project and it's active community of game dev enthusiasts have opened this 
blog to post about the latest updates, news and anything awesome happening 
in gamedev.

Although most of the HaxeFlixel activity happens on Github, Slack chat (ask for an invite)
and the @haxeflixel twitter this is resource can help inform new users.

Like everything HaxeFlixel, this blog is open for contributions from github by editing the 
markdown files, just like our [documentation](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-docs).

Feel free to fork and improve these blog posts and the website itself.
