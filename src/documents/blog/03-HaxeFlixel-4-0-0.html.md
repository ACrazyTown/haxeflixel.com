We are proud to announce the release of HaxeFlixel 4.0.0! This is without a doubt the biggest release yet, with nearly 2000 new commits on the core repository alone since the last release.

The highlights of this release are:

* an improved API structure
* a refactored rendering system
* a much improved gamepad API
* improved HTML5 support
* improved OpenFL Next compatibility
* an improved debugger console (now using hscript) with auto-completion
* over 20 new demos
* ...and much more

For a more in-depth breakdown of the changes, have a look at our [changelog](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). If you are mostly interested in the breaking changes to upgrade a project using HaxeFlixel 3.3.x, please refer to the [upgrade guide](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/upgrade-guide-4-0-0/).

We would like to thank all contributors who helped with this release in any way, as well as [our Patreon supporters](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=94916&ty=p).

Between 06/2015 and 02/2016 HaxeFlixel Patreon Funds were allocated as follows:

* $10 to [Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bjorn) for his work on Tiled map editor.
* $79.18 to [Justo Delgado](https://twitter.com/jdbaudi) for work improving OpenFL shader API.
* $39.99 to [Chris Decoster](https://twitter.com/impaler12) for website hosting expenses.
* $100 to [Jeff Ward](https://twitter.com/Jeff__Ward) for his work developing a Haxe plugin for Visual Studio Code.
* $198.13 to [Samuel Batista](https://twitter.com/gamedevsam) for US income taxes.

As of 02/01/2016 HaxeFlixel has $492.23 available for developer funding.

Going forward, there are two things we want to foucs on:
	
* **A stable API** - Breaking changes should be the exception and only happen in major releases. This also means following [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) more closely.
* **More frequent releases** - 4.0.0 took longer than it should have. We aim to have smaller releases in the future, but release more frequently.
