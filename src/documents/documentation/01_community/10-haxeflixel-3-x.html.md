title: "HaxeFlixel 3.x"
```

HaxeFlixel has always been a project to improve on what Flixel is and bring new life to the code where
Adam Atomic has left it in Actionscript 3. By choosing OpenFL and Haxe we have given new opportunities
to Flixel projects and with HaxeFlixel 3.0 we have also evolved the Flixel API itself.

The strongest criticism we have seen for Flixel has been a description of the codebase as "bloated" and
it lack of documentation. Each of these criticisms has been taken on board and we are happy to share we
have significant progress on each.


#### What happened to HaxeFlixel 2.0?

With the API changes we believe it only makes sense to avoid confusion for legacy Flixel 2.55 users not
to expect the same API for the latest release of HaxeFlixel. Instead 3.0 is an evolution of the original
Flixel api with a focus on logic names and structure that makes more sense to the end user a more sensible
package structure which should make it easier to maintain.


#### So what has changed, is Flixel still bloated?

Flixel has always a large collection of useful code to build many game types quickly and easily without
reinventing the wheel each time. In this sense Flixel will always be a large codebase, however we believe
Flixel is now more organized and logical. Let us explain why.

However big the changes which there are many, it is still easy for existing Flixel users to learn and adopt.

With our users in mind we have a project to assist you in updating old code. This tool is mostly a simple Find and Replace script that will replace old api calls with the new ones where its easily automated. This tool is not a perfect conversion tool but a handy tool to make the updating process quicker. Checkout the [flixel-tools docs](/documentation/flixel-tools) for more info.
