title: "Code Contributions"
```

Contributing code to HaxeFlixel is done all through the official git repositories on Github. We make use of the pull request feature and suggest developers use a feature branch model.

###Feature branches

Git feature branches allow work to be developed that may have deep breaking changes on the codebase.
The general rule is to simply fork the project and create a new branch with a name that best describes the feature your developing.

###Merge Approval

Before a major feature is merged into core our general workflow is to get approval from 2 or more contributors with push access.
If it is hard to get consensus on a major change all developers involved agree the original author of this project (Beeblerox) has the more important vote.

Developers do have limited time so keep in mind some simple steps to get your pull request accepted:

- Clearly describe your use case or the problem/issue your code is developed for.
- Conduct as much testing as possible on the supported targets of HaxeFlixel. If the code is for a specific target only make a clear note for developers to test.
- Provide a link to a working, compilable demo of your code.
