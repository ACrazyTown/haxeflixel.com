This website is built using the Docpad system which compiles the files to a static site on a community sponsored host.

### Our Docs

The documentation pages are written in the markdown format. You can see the files written in markdown from the extension *.html.md.

The markdown format is parsed through [marked](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-marked) with the github markdown syntax enabled.
You can see a guide for the markdown [syntax here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).
