Welcome to HaxeFlixel, here we will show you how to setup your system to start making games with Mac, Linux or Windows.

HaxeFlixel is an [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) library that makes heavy use of the Haxe Toolkit and the Open Flash Library. These two systems have to be installed and setup prior to using HaxeFlixel. It is helpful if you have some basic knowledge of programming and installing software.

----

The basic steps to get started on Windows and Mac are:

1. [Install Haxe](/documentation/install-haxe)
2. [Install OpenFL](/documentation/install-openfl)
3. [Install HaxeFlixel](/documentation/install-haxeflixel)
4. [Compile Hello World](/documentation/hello-world-command-line)
5. [Choose An IDE](/documentation/choose-an-ide)

If you are planning to use linux:

- [Review or use our installer script]()

With a working installation you can now:

- [Compile Hello World](/documentation/compile-hello-world)
- [Choose An IDE](/documentation/choose-an-ide)

----

Time to complete this installation is close to 20 minutes, mostly due to downloading the components.
