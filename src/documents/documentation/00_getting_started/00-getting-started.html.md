Welcome to HaxeFlixel, here we will show you how to setup your system to start making games with Mac, Linux or Windows.

HaxeFlixel is an [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) library that makes heavy use of the [Haxe Toolkit](http://haxe.org) and the [Open Flash Library](http://openfl.org). 

All you need to get started is basic knowledge of programming and software to get started.

----

The basic steps to get started on Windows and Mac are:

1. [Install Haxe](/documentation/install-haxe)
2. [Install OpenFL](/documentation/install-openfl)
3. [Install HaxeFlixel](/documentation/install-haxeflixel)
4. [Compile Hello World](/documentation/hello-world-command-line)

If you are planning to use linux:

- [Review or use our installer script]()

With a working installation you can now:

- [Compile Hello World](/documentation/compile-hello-world)

----

Time to complete this installation is close to 20 minutes, mostly due to downloading the components.

If you require some help, ask a question in the [community forums](http://www.forum.haxeflixel.com) also worth checking out [#haxeflixel on IRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/#haxeflixel).
