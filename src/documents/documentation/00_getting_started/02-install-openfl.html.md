title: "Install OpenFL"
```

Installing OpenFL is best done through haxelib. To do so, run the following commands:

``` bash
haxelib install lime
haxelib run lime setup
lime install openfl
```

## Setup

You can begin using OpenFL right away on the Flash, Neko or HTML5 targets, but some targets require a little extra setup.

``` bash
lime setup windows
lime setup android
lime setup blackberry
```
