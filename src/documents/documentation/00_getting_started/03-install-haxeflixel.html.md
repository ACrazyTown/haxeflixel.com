```
title: "Install HaxeFlixel"
```

You can install the latest stable version from haxelib with the following command:

``` bash
haxelib install flixel
```

After this, you can compile to Flash and Neko out of the box. 
To compile to desktop and mobile targets, you have to make sure you have run their respective `lime setup` command (see previous step).

## Updating HaxeFlixel

You can use the following command to just update flixel:
	
``` bash
haxelib update flixel
```

Alternatively, you can update all libraries at once with this command:
	
``` bash
haxelib upgrade
```	

## Development version

If you are interested in using bleeding edge code from the development branch [on GitHub](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel), see [instructions here](/documentation/install-development-flixel).
