Using these targets requires the appropriate SDK's and system setup assisted through the OpenFL setup commands.

```
openfl setup windows
openfl setup mac
openfl setup android
openfl setup blackberry
```

### Html5

Html5 although entirely possible with OpenFL has not currently been the focus of the project.
However basic rendering does work and BunnyMark has produced some encouraging results.
Contributions to this target are encouraged, support for alternative Html5 backends are worth investigation such as [BitFive.](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife/openfl-bitfive)
