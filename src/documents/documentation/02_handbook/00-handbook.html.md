Welcome to the HaxeFlixel handbook. These pages are intended to answer common questions and explain the main ideas and structures behind most HaxeFlixel games.
As the types of games and use cases of HaxeFlixel are vast we appreciate developers making additions and improvements to this documentation through [github](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/haxeflixel.com).

If you are familiar with AS3 and new to Haxe we encourage you to read the [comparison to Haxe](/documentation/as3-and-haxe-comparison).

HaxeFlixel's API is largely the same as the AS3 version, and existing documentation and resources for Actionscript 3 are still relevant.
The biggest changes in the API were made in HaxeFlixel 3.x you can review the changes on the [HaxeFlixel 3.x page.](/documentation/haxeflixel-3-x)
