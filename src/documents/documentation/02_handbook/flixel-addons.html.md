Due to Flixel's community, popularity and success the codebase is fairly large. HaxeFlixel developers have worked to organise the core Flixel repository into the most important features and have moved community contributions and plugins to this repository. 

Flixel Addons is a Haxelib hosted on the main HaxeFlixel account just like the core and is easily used in your project by adding the following xml node to your project.xml.

	<haxelib name="flixel-addons" />
