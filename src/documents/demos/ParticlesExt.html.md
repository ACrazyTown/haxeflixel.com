A demo showing off the [FlxEmitterExt](http://forums.flixel.org/index.php?topic=4016.0)&nbsp;class in comparison to the original FlxEmitter class. The class and the [demo ](https://github.com/krix/ParticleTest)were originally created by [krix ](https://github.com/krix)and then ported to Haxe.

The main difference between the two emitter classes is that FlxEmitterExt spawns particles in a circle instead of a square, which makes it look a lot better for explosions. It also features a new setMotion() function.
